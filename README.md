# PythonAndMe
The programming in python is one of my dreams that is happening, that is the reason why i am very excite.
This is my journey where i am learning Python language.

I have attached the comments in each code so that you can understand logical importance of each line.

I have also attached the numbers in .py files such as "1 - <file_name>". Here file name can be anything but with the number attached you can find that from where to start and where to go.

I have also did the same with folders.

Even you can consider it as a complete beginenr guid for any fresh person to learn; it is because i have added every thing in such a way that anybody can understad.

If you have any qury regarding this repository or any .py files so you can contact me.
