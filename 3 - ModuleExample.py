"""
--> Modules
    these are the code written by some other person usually,
    which we can use directly in our program if it is needed...

--> Types of module
    there are two types of modules...
    (1) In-built modules 
        --> which are pre-installed with python...
            simpally we have to import them to use...
            ex. time,os,abc,etc.
    (2) External modules
        --> which needed to be installed manually or by using pip...
            ex. Tensorflow,flask,etc.

--> time is type of in-built module and demonstration of it, 
    is shown below...
"""


import time #in-built module

#import flask #this line will give error...

#module is like a library in other languages...

time.sleep(2) #functionality of a time module...
print("2 seconds have passed since this program has ran")



"""
--> pip
    it is a package manager for python.
    we can use it to install various External modules as shown below.

    ex.
    pip install flask

    it will automatically install flask module by which we can make 
    web-sites easily...
