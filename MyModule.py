It is said that,

'When i wrote this code, only God and i understood what it did...and now, only God knows!!'

To avoid the scenarios like above, the concept of Module is there.
By the help of modules...
--> we can group similar kind of functions or classes that performs/serves to same services
--> we can divide big task into smaller tasks and then later on merge
--> we can reuse the moules, hence the re-usability is increased
--> working/maintaining big projects is made easy
etc...
